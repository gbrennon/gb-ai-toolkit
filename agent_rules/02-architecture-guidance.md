# Architecture Guidance

Enforce architectural decisions and prevent structural drift. These rules apply when writing, reviewing, or refactoring any code in the project.

## Single Responsibility at the File Level

### One Contract Per File
- Never place multiple unrelated abstractions (interfaces, protocols, ABCs) in the same file
- Never implement multiple domain services, use cases, or handlers in a single file
- Never mix domain logic with infrastructure logic in the same file — each file belongs to exactly one architectural layer
- Split a file the moment it grows to serve two distinct concerns or two different callers

### Module-Like Files Are Forbidden
- Never create "module" files that re-export unrelated symbols from different subsystems just for convenience
- Never create "barrel" files that aggregate public APIs from across layers — each layer manages its own public surface
- Package initializers, like `__init__.py`, `mod.rs`, `package-info.java`, and other entry-module files, should ONLY re-export without logic. Re-export only the symbols that form the immediate package's public contract, and only from within that same package

## Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)

### Always Define a Contract First
- When the project applies ports and adapters, every external boundary must be defined as a port (interface, protocol, or ABC) in the domain or application layer
- Always write the port before writing any adapter that implements it
- Never let infrastructure code define the contract — the inner layer owns the abstraction

### Adapters Stay in Infrastructure
- All concrete implementations of ports belong in the infrastructure layer
- Never import infrastructure modules (HTTP clients, database drivers, file I/O, external SDKs) into domain or application code
- Adapters must be injected through the port — never instantiated directly in business logic

### Contract Verification
- Every port must be testable through a fake or stub implementation without any real infrastructure
- Every adapter must have an integration test that verifies it satisfies the port contract against a real dependency

## Respect Established Principles

### Detect and Follow Project Conventions
- Before writing code, identify which architectural patterns are already applied in the project (hexagonal, CQRS, event sourcing, layered, etc.)
- Never introduce a new architectural pattern that conflicts with an existing one
- When in doubt about which pattern applies, default to the one already established in the same layer or subsystem

### SOLID is Non-Negotiable
- Every class, module, and function must have a single reason to change
- Prefer extension over modification — use abstractions and composition, not conditional branching on type
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without weakening preconditions or strengthening postconditions
- Prefer narrow, role-specific interfaces over fat ones — clients must not depend on methods they do not use
- Always depend on abstractions, never on concretions — inject dependencies, never instantiate collaborators with `new` inside business logic

### Composition Over Inheritance
- Never use inheritance where composition is more appropriate
- Inheritance is acceptable only for true "is-a" relationships with substitutability, and only when the base class is designed for extension
- Prefer dependency injection and strategy/decorator patterns over deep inheritance hierarchies

### Domain Purity
- Domain objects must carry behavior, not just data — avoid anemic domain models
- Domain logic must never depend on infrastructure (no HTTP, no database, no file I/O, no external APIs)
- Prefer immutable data structures and pure functions in the domain layer

## Structural Red Flags

When reviewing or writing code, treat these as violations:

- A file containing both an interface and an unrelated helper function — split them
- A domain service importing `requests`, `sqlalchemy`, `boto3`, `axios`, `jackson`, or any I/O library — move that logic to an adapter
- A `__init__.py`, `mod.rs`, or package initializer re-exporting symbols from a different top-level package — remove the cross-layer dependency
- A class with more than one responsibility or more than ~7 public methods — decompose it
- A function that mixes domain rules with infrastructure calls — extract the infrastructure behind a port
- Inheritance used to share utility code rather than to model a true subtype relationship — refactor to composition
